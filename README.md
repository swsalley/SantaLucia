Research on Soils and Ecological Sites on the Santa Lucia Conservancy 

## Santa Lucia Conservancy

The Santa Lucia Conservancy is a non-profit land trust incorporated in 1995 to conserve the ecological integrity of the protected lands within the Santa Lucia Preserve in Carmel, California. The conservancy is dedicated to advancing the art and science of conservation-compatible development through adaptive land management, conservation easement stewardship, ecological research and environmental education programs. 

## Statement of Work

Through a strategic partnership, soil and rangeland scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) have begun a multi-year project to map and classify soils and Ecological Sites with the Santa Lucia Conservancy (SLC). This partnership will provide expertise and advice on rangeland ecology, development of Ecological Site Descriptions, and conduct statistical analysis of grazing and landscape data to evaluate grassland/rangeland response to the SLCâ€™s targeted grazing program.

## Ecological Sites

Ecological Sites (ES) are defined as conceptual subdivisions of the landscape, based on static soil and climate properties, to organize information relevant to land use and management.  ES are the finest spatiotemporal scale tool available to land managers. The spatial grouping of ES information is designed to be applied to fields with specific topo-edaphic characteristics; the temporal scale is designed to provide a framework for yearly, multi-year and decadal decisions. ES are the only soil survey-based product that brings together static and dynamic properties relevant to land management.
